                1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened
            </li>
            <li>
                1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper
            </li>
            <li>
                1 teaspoon herbes de Provence
            </li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Gather the ingredients. Place prime rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, 2 to 4 hours. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until well blended. Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast. Season roast generously with kosher salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roast the 4-pound roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. (If your roast is larger or smaller than 4 pounds, multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn the oven off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed, let the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove roast from the oven, slice, and serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
