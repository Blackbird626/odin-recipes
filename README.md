This project serves as a quick test of basic HTML and HTML alone. 

It goes over basic HTML tags, including lists, headings, and paragraphs. It also uses links to a few different recipes.

This project is important because it utilizes the basic HTML skills that I have learned.

Do note that CSS styling was added after the original completion.
